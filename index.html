            <h1><strong>Effects of your environment</strong></h1>
            <p>Our environment affects us in many ways but productivity is the most valued thing to a student. The room you sit in can change your mood, 
            your learning and engagement. The air quality can impact productivity. The amount of sunlight can lower your tension. Although some effects from the environment are subjective to personal preference.</p>
            <h1><strong>Why should you care?</strong></h1>
            <p>Small things can add up. Students already have alot going on in their lives and changing small things to improve their productivity can be the difference from a roadblock or writer's block and completing their assignments. </p>
            <h1><strong>What is the purpose of this website?</strong></h1>
            <p>To get students to look at their room as a factor. Sometimes I move to a different room if I am stuck on a assignment and it helps me keep going. Maybe this will help someone else.</p>
            <h1><strong>Medium and Engagment</strong></h1>
            <p>Students search online on how to get out of writers block or similiar things. A small, quick and simple website or statement is what students want.</p>
